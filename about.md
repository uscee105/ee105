## Course Overview

This introductory course offers a broad overview of electronic systems, integrating both hardware and software perspectives. Students will explore the fundamental building blocks of electronics, including basic circuits and key components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, diodes, transistors, optoelectronic devices, and sensors. A central feature of the course is the hands-on design, construction, and testing of an optical biosensor that synthesizes concepts learned throughout the semester. Students will also be introduced to foundational topics in signals and systems, as well as neural networks, culminating in the implementation of a simple image classification system using embedded machine learning. Another major focus is on communication systems, particularly free-space optical communication, where students will build and experiment with paired light emitters and detectors. Hands-on learning is supported by a custom demonstration board, which includes modules for circuits, devices, system integration, and AI/ML-based image processing. In summary, this course provides an engaging introduction to electrical engineering, emphasizing experiential learning through the development of intelligent hardware and software systems.

## Resources

There is no textbook for the course, however, required readings, viewings, and other course resources are available via web links on this syllabus/website, posts on Brightspace, and through email. Brightspace and the course website will be used for general announcements, for posting of course documents and information.
