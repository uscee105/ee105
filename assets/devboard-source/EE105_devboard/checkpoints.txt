Things to ask professor:
- Resistor values of the uneven resistor network
- No analog read with for uneven resistor network?
- Female headers for the voltage divider
- Powe On/Off different modules?
- Toggle between different application in a module (for example SW10:Toggle between voltage divider and network, sw11: toggle between diode and nmos)

Checkpoints:
- Check the PPG module by adafruit if it has any supporting circuit on top of the IC
- Check the DAC module like above
- Check if op-amp need any additional circuit
- Figure out the sense resistor value (Two resistors in module 2 and one resistor in module 3)
- Verify PPG circuit (VLED+ resistor)
- PPG sensor RLED and IRLED driver
- Add tp to the ground in module 1
- Toggle switch for modules not within the modules
- Using transimpidence amp (Try both)
- Use multiple channel output
- For Module 3 select LED and photodiode with dip package
